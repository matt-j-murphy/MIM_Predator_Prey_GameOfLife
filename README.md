**Predators** = 1's (YELLOW)

**Prey** = 0.5's (TEAL)

**Dead/Non-Existent** = 0's (DARK BLUE)
  
  
  
**Instructions**:
- Run pred_check_neighbors AND pred_show_stuff first. These functions have no outputs, but will be called later.
- Then, run pred_game_of_life in order to begin the game visualization :)
