**Predators** = 1's (YELLOW)

**Prey** = 0.5's (TEAL)

**Dead/Non-Existent** = 0's (DARK BLUE)

Several live prey and four live predators are generated on a matrix of zeros. According to survival rules that we dictate, predators and prey will either spawn or die in the next generation. The code checks the neighboring individuals of each cell type, implements the rules, and displays the generations over time.
